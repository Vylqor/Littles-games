# Littles Games

A collection of small terminal games written in Python.

## Games

### Hangman

Guess the hidden word one letter at a time before you run out of attempts.

File: `Handman_minigame.py`

### Snake

Control the snake, eat the food, and try to achieve the highest score without
hitting the wall or yourself.

File: `Snake.py`

### Tic Tac Toe

Two players take turns placing `X` and `O`. The first player to align three
symbols wins.

File: `TicTacToe.py`

### Treasure Run

Explore the ruins, collect every gem, avoid the guards, and reach the exit.

File: `Treasure_Run.py`

### The Lost Dungeon

Explore a hidden dungeon, find the key, collect treasures, avoid traps, and
reach the exit before you run out of lives.

File: `The_lost_Dungeon.py`

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Windows is recommended for Snake because it uses `msvcrt` and the Windows
  console API for real-time keyboard input.

## Installation

Clone the repository and open its folder:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Vylqor/Littles-games.git
cd Littles-games
```

No external Python packages are required. The games use only the Python
standard library.
